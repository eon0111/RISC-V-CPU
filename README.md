# RISC-V-CPU
This is my master's degree final thesis. I'll be adding pipelining capabilities to an existing RISC-V single cycle design. This design was originally made by [Jim Huang](https://github.com/jserv) and [Yin-Hsun Hung](https://github.com/eeeXun), from the National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), and its code can be found [here](https://github.com/sysprog21/ca2023-lab3).
